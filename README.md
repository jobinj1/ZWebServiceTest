A simple SAP web service iOS client for practice

Now that it is possible to define oData services in SAP, it is very unlikely I will go back to web services as a method of exposing SAP backend data. I did this project way back in September 2012 when I was just starting off in iOS programming and SAP web services. So please don't judge my coding abilities, or blame me for any damages you might incur when using this code for learning or other purposes.
